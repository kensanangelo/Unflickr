# Unflickr
A Flickr-like application built on the MEAN stack for DIG4503-Rapid Application Development at UCF.

This assignment was to use the MEAN stack to create a fully functional Flickr-like application with features such as image uploads, user accounts and user comments. 

In order to use this, you will need a server running the MEAN stack.
